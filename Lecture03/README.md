# Python Basics Tutorial Notebook

This notebook provides a comprehensive introduction to fundamental Python programming concepts, focusing on data types, control structures, and file path handling. It's designed for beginners learning Python in a scientific context, with examples using chemical elements and laboratory scenarios.

## Contents

1. **Python Data Types**
   - Numeric types (int, float, complex)
   - Sequence types (str, list, tuple)
   - Mapping types (dict)
   - Sets and Boolean types
   - Comprehensive examples and exercises
   - List operations and methods

2. **Control Structures - Loops**
   - While loops with practical examples
   - For loops and iteration
   - Loop control (break, continue)
   - Index-based iteration
   - List modification exercises

3. **Path Handling**
   - Introduction to pathlib
   - Cross-platform path management
   - Directory and file operations
   - Path manipulation exercises

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of Python syntax
- Python 3.x installed
- Familiarity with command line interface

## Exercises

The notebook includes practical exercises covering:
- List manipulation and slicing
- Boolean logic and conditional statements
- Loop implementation and control flow
- File system operations
- Type conversion and data handling

Each section contains both guided examples and challenge exercises with real-world applications in scientific contexts.

## Usage

Work through the notebook sequentially, as concepts build upon each other. Complete all exercises to reinforce learning. Code examples can be run independently to experiment with different scenarios.

## Notes

- The notebook uses chemistry-related examples to demonstrate programming concepts
- Pay special attention to the path handling section for cross-platform compatibility
- Some exercises are designed to identify and fix common programming mistakes
