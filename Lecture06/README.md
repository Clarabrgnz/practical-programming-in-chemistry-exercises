# Lecture 06: Introduction to RDKit

RDKit is a powerful open-source cheminformatics toolkit designed to simplify chemical data processing. Importantly, it has specialized classes to deal with molecular structures, allowing us to easily represent, modify, and visualize molecules. RDKit is a useful tool both in research and in industry (and some of your TA's proudly consider themselves RDKit hackers :sunglasses:)

Today we will go through some of RDKit's most useful functionalities:
1. **Reading, writing, and visualizing molecular data**
2. **Calculating descriptors**
3. **Representing molecules with "fingerprints".** 


## Setup

This week, we need one extra package: `py3Dmol`. Install it with `pip` into your `ppchem` environment. Update the `.env` file just like you did yesterday. Try to see what you remember from yesterday, but if you need help, walk through the instructions in Lecture05 with `py3Dmol` instead of `matplotlib`. 


## Exercise

Now you're ready to give the [exercises](06_exercise.ipynb) a go!
